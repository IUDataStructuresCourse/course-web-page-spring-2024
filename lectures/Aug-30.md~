a number x is even if ∃ k. 2 k = x

6 is even!
Prove it: k=3 is the witness

Theorem. If x and y are even, then x + y is even.
Proof.
x is even => ∃ k. 2 k = x => 2 k₁ = x
y is even => ∃ k. 2 k = y => 2 k₂ = y

x + y = 2k₁ + 2k₂ = 2(k₁ + k₂)

Goal: x + y is even.
=> ∃ k. 2 k = x + y
=> 2 ___ = x + y

witness: k= k₁ + k₂
