* Binomial Heaps

Please review [[https://iudatastructurescourse.github.io/course-web-page-fall-2023/lectures/Oct-16.html][Monday's lecture notes]] before you start.
*Also, directly copying code from textbook Section 6.8 does not work!*

** The ~BinomialHeap~ class:

+ corresponds to a tree
+ each node has a ~PList~ of children, sorted in descending heights
+ ~link()~ connects two $B_k$ and get one $B_{k+1}$:
  * keys of the root nodes are compared by ~lessEq.test()~
  * used in ~insert()~ and (the binary long addition version of) ~merge()~
+ ~isHeap()~ decides if the tree satisfies the (max) heap property

** The ~BinomialQueue~ class:

+ corresponds to a forest
+ trees sorted in ascending heights
+ ~isHeap()~: if each tree satisfies the heap property, then the entire
   forest is a heap
+ ~insert()~:
   * if the height of the tree is less than that of the first tree in
     the forest, cons the tree to the front and we're done
   * otherwise, find tree whose height is equal to the tree to insert,
     link those two trees and recursively insert result into the rest of
     the forest
+ ~merge()~, two ways, both acceptable for this lab:
  * the slow $O(log^2(n))$ way: insert trees in one forest one by one
    into the other
  * the appropriate $O(log(n))$ way: analogous to long addition of binary numbers
    * has proper time complexity, but is a little tricky to implement
    * [example] (adapted from textbook Fig. 6.36 - 6.38)
